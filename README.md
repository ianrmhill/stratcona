# Stratcona: Bayesian Inference and Accelerated Test Design for Semiconductor Reliability Analyses
This software library implements a probabilistic modelling framework for Bayesian analysis of semiconductor reliability
models.


## Demos
The 'demos' folder contains pre-built examples of how to use this library to conduct various analyses. The IRPS 2025
studies are the most complete at present and demonstrate using the probabilistic modelling framework for performing
Bayesian inference to learn predictive models for semiconductor wear-out.


## Citing Stratcona
If you use this library as part of your research it would be greatly appreciated if you could cite our 2025 IEEE
International Reliability Physics Symposium paper in any resulting publications. DOI coming once the paper is published.
